# Shell Processes and Signals

This project focuses on learning and implementing various concepts related to Unix/Linux processes and signals using Bash scripting.

## Concepts Covered
- Process management in Linux
- PID (Process ID)
- Process signals
- Background processes
- Foreground processes
- Signal handling
- Service management
- Init scripts
- Daemon processes

## Project Files

### Basic Process Management
- `0-what-is-my-pid`: Display current process PID
- `1-list_your_processes`: Show all running processes
- `2-show_your_bash_pid`: Find bash process PID
- `3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy`: Alternative way to find bash PID

### Process Control
- `4-to_infinity_and_beyond`: Infinite loop process
- `5-dont_stop_me_now`: Stop a process using kill
- `6-stop_me_if_you_can`: Stop a process without kill
- `7-highlander`: Process with signal handling
- `8-beheaded_process`: Kill a specific process

### Advanced Process and Signal Management
- `10-process_and_pid_file`: PID file creation and signal handling
- `11-manage_my_process`: Init script for process management
- `manage_my_process`: Background process script

## Requirements
- All scripts are tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All scripts are executable
- All scripts pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without errors
